## What's it?
Glasscord is a really simple tool that enables window composition effects (transparency and frosted glass effects) on Discord.

It is compatible with Windows, Linux and macOS.

## So, is it a theme?
Glasscord is NOT a theme. It's a tool that enables themes to request composition effects.

To put it in other, more simple words, you will need a theme that supports Glasscord to be able to see it in action.

## But why?
I was bored and I made an early proof of concept to post on [r/unixporn](https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/comments/fu0bqh/kde_stop_blurry_discord/).
It seemed that a few people liked the idea, so I made that into an actual tool for themers.

_TL;DR: Help me I have no purpose in this life anymore_

## Is it compatible with _[name of random Discord plugin loader here]_?
If installed properly, Glasscord won't interfere with any modern plugin loaders.
In fact, I tested it with EnhancedDiscord and it works flawlessly!

**Note:** Someone reported that BetterDiscord installs are a little bit trickier to get working with Glasscord.
Please follow the instructions carefully and please install Glasscord AFTER installing BetterDiscord!

## How do I install it?
Well, glad you asked!

- Download this GitHub repository or look in the Releases section for stable releases to download.
  If you downloaded a zip file, extract it to have convenient access to its files.
- Locate your Discord Desktop Core module folder.
  - On Linux, it is `$HOME/.config/discord/x.x.x/modules/discord_desktop_core/`
  - On Windows, it is `%AppData%\discord\x.x.x\modules\discord_desktop_core\`
  - On macOS, it is `~/Library/Application Support/discord/x.x.x/modules/discord_desktop_core/`
- Put the `glasscord.js` file inside that folder.
- If you are on Windows, you should also put the `ewc.asar` file inside that folder.
- Edit the `index.js` file which was already in that folder.
  
  The text inside that file
  ```
  [bunch of random stuff if you have mods installed]
  module.exports = require('./core.asar');
  ```
  should become
  ```
  require('./glasscord.js');
  [bunch of random stuff if you have mods installed]
  module.exports = require('./core.asar');
  ```
  so you really have to write `require('./glasscord.js');` at the **absolute beginning** of that file.
- You can now start Discord and Glasscord would be running!

## How do I USE it?
Glasscord alone won't do anything to your Discord client. You WILL need a CSS loader at least to be able to use Glasscord.
Plus, you can choose which CSS loader to use; we're not reinventing the wheel here.

You then have to make or find a compatible theme to have the blur effect. If you are just trying stuff, you can load the `glasscord_example_theme.css` on your CSS loader of choice.

We recommend to install our modified CSS Loader for EnhancedDiscord, so please get it first, then override
the `css_loader.js` file on ED's plugins directory with the one on this repository!

## Hey buddy I am a theme creator, how should I support Glasscord in my own themes?
Glasscord will look for some CSS properties defined in the `:root` CSS selector.
Please take a look at the `glasscord_example_theme.css` file to better understand how they are used.

Here's a straightforward CSS properties explaination. Let's go through them one by one; shall we?

### `--glasscord-enable`
#### accepts a `bool`; defaults to `false`
This is the global switch. Turn it off, and Glasscord is off too.

### `--glasscord-tint`
#### accepts a `color`; defaults to `#00000000` which is transparent
Global background color of the Discord window.

On Windows it's set via the compositor; it's set via Electron otherwise.

On 99% of cases, it will behave the same as if you included `body { background-color: color; }` on your CSS file.

Nobody is sure if this will prove useful later, but it's here anyway.

### `--glasscord-win-blur` (Windows)
#### accepts a value between those ones: `acrylic`, `blurbehind`, `transparent`; defaults to `acrylic`
Sets the blur type on Windows.
- `acrylic` refers to the strong blur used in Microsoft's Fluent Design. Note: it can be slow when dragging/resizing on some Windows versions.
- `blurbehind` is a weaker blur than the other one, and it kinda resembles the good old Aero Glass effect.
- `transparent` means no blur at all, so the window is just transparent.

### `--glasscord-win-performance-mode` (Windows)
#### accepts a `bool`; defaults to `true`
If you're using `acrylic` as the blur type used on Windows, setting this property will use the `blurbehind` blur type
when you're resizing or moving a window.

This is lame, but since some Windows versions are affected by an annoying bug causing a slowdown upon resizing/moving the Discord window,
there was really no other choice but to implement it.

Let's hope for Microsoft to fix this bug in upcoming Windows releases.

### `--glasscord-macos-vibrancy` (macOS)
#### accepts a value between those ones: `titlebar`, `selection`, `menu`, `popover`, `sidebar`, `header`, `sheet`, `window`, `hud`, `fullscreen-ui`, `tooltip`, `content`, `under-window`, `under-page`, `none`; defaults to `none`
Sets the vibrancy effects to be used with the Discord window.

If set to `none`, the vibrancy effect will not be applied but the window will be blurred anyway.

@Giovix92 did some testing for you guys, and he made this handy dandy chart to pick vibrancy effects

| Vibrancy mode                                 | Slight description                                           |
|-----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| fullscreen-ui, titlebar, menu, popover, sheet | Reference vibrancy, works in maximized and minimized windows |
| selection                                     | Has kind of a bright tint to it                              |
| hud                                           | The one with the most contrast and vibrancy                  |
| header                                        | It won't work in fullscreen, and it's slightly darker        |
| tooltip, sidebar                              | Darker than the reference vibrancy                           |
| under-window                                  | The darkest of them all                                      |
| under-page, window, content                   | Won't show any sign of blurring                              |

### `--glasscord-linux-blur` (Linux)
#### accepts a `bool`; defaults to `true`
Tells the window compositor whether to blur behind Discord or not.

**Note:** for this setting to work, you should be running an X session. Wayland support is not possible at this stage.
You should also be running a supported window compositor, and Glasscord currently only supports KWin.

You can still manually blur Discord's window via Compiz, Compton and similar compositors which support blurring windows manually.
